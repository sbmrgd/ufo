A space shooter written in micropython for the pokitto

This was my entry for the micropython competition:
You have to defend your planet against aliens by shooting ufos. 
There are three types of ufos: a big one , a medium one and a small one. 
In the left upper corner there is some kind of a compass that gives an idea where the current ufo is situated. 
You have 2 minutes to shoot as many ufos as possible:
Controls:
d-pad controls your ship
a-button fires the lasers
b-button goes to game over screen
c-button: starts game
